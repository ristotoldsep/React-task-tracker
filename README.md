## React app for adding tasks with CRUD operations - also used mock DB json-server to practice connecting react components with back-end

### User can:
* Open/Close the task adding form
* Set a title, date and a reminder (Also possible to set/remove the reminder by double-clicking on the task (PUT request to the db) )
* Delete tasks

* Also added react router dom & an about page to implement switching views!

# Results:

#### Form opened
